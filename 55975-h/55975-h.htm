<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Foreword</span></h2>
<p>In late summer of 1977, the United States launched two unmanned Voyager spacecraft on
an extensive reconnaissance of the outer planets, a decade-long odyssey that could take them
to 3 planets and as many as 18 planetary satellites. The first encounter was with the giant
Jovian planetary system, 645 million kilometers (400 million miles) away. Passing by Jupiter
and its complex satellite system in 1979, the Voyager spacecraft have collected and returned to
Earth an enormous amount of data and information that may prove to be a keystone in understanding
our solar system.</p>
<p>This publication provides an early look at the Jovian planetary system and contains a
selected sample from the more than 30,000 images collected during this phase of the Voyager
mission. While Voyager achieved an impressive record of accomplishments, full realization of
the scientific value of this program must await the remaining Voyager encounters with Saturn
and perhaps Uranus, and a detailed analysis of the data from all the spacecraft investigations.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>In March 1979 Voyager 1 swept past Jupiter, photographing
both the giant planet and five of its moons. Four
months later, a companion spacecraft, Voyager 2, made a
similar encounter. Now, with Jupiter receding behind them,
both spacecraft are headed toward the outer reaches of our
solar system. In November 1980, Voyager 1 will fly past Saturn.
Voyager 2, traveling at slower speeds, will reach the
same way station in August 1981. Beyond there, the itinerary
is less certain. In January 1986, eight years after its
departure from Earth, Voyager 2 may sail within range of
Uranus, taking closeup pictures of that distant planet for the
first time. Long after they have exhausted their fuel supplies
and their radios have fallen silent, both spacecraft will continue
their traverse through space and beyond our solar system,
on an endless journey.</p>

<p>Preliminary results of the Voyager encounters with Jupiter
are presented in this booklet. As you examine the pictures,
you will be participating in a revolutionary journey of exploration.
Living in a society where many accomplishments
and products are billed as &ldquo;extraordinary,&rdquo; &ldquo;stupendous,&rdquo;
&ldquo;once in a lifetime,&rdquo; or &ldquo;unique,&rdquo; we sometimes lose our perspective.
Conditioned to hyperbole, we fail to recognize those
advances that are truly exceptional. We need a historian&rsquo;s
vantage point to identify the events that can literally change
the course of civilization. So it is that every student of history
recognizes the importance of the Renaissance, an
extraordinary time when man looked outward, reaching
beyond the traditions of the past to study his place in the
natural world. The results were apparent in art, architecture,
and literature, in new philosophic and governmental systems,
and in the staggering scientific revolution exemplified
by Galileo&rsquo;s first examination of the heavens with a telescope,
and in his stubborn support of the heretical assertion
that the Earth was <i>not</i> the center of the solar system.</p>
<p>Historians writing a hundred or two hundred years from
now may well look on the latter part of the twentieth century
as another turning point in civilization. For the first time, we
explored beyond Earth&mdash;first the Moon, then the neighboring
planets, and finally the outermost planets, the very fringe
of our solar system.</p>
<p>How will the historian evaluate this period of exploration?
First, perhaps, he will describe the Apollo program as
a visionary example of great cooperative ventures that can
be accomplished by many individuals, private companies,
and government institutions. He will describe the subsequent
space ventures that weave a fabric of cooperation and
goodwill between nations.</p>
<p>He will point out the technological advances incorporated
in unmanned spacecraft, sophisticated robots able
to control their own activities and solve their own problems.
He will mention the revolution in microelectronics&mdash;the art
of fabricating complex electrical control circuits so small the
eye cannot perceive them, a revolution accelerated by the
requirement to conserve weight and generate performance
in interplanetary spacecraft. He will point to the introduction
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
of new products, particularly in areas of communication,
medical treatment, and energy conversion.</p>

<p>Turning his attention to the environment, the historian
will almost surely suggest that the first widespread realization
of the fragile natural balances on Earth came at a time
when we were first able to see our Earth in its entirety. The
impact of a picture of Earth from deep space, a luminously
blue globe surrounded by darkness, has probably been more
persuasive than lengthy treatises describing the complex ways
in which our system of rocks, plants, animals, water, and air
is interrelated. On a more practical level, the historian will
point to the new understanding of our terrestrial environment.
The composition and structure of other planetary
atmospheres&mdash;on Venus, Mars, and Jupiter&mdash;provide
important clues to what may happen in our own atmosphere,
especially if we disrupt the chemical composition.
Study of the primitive crusts of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury
permits us to reconstruct the first billion years of Earth
history, a time when chemical elements were being concentrated
in activity ultimately leading to the formation of
important ore deposits. Unmanned spacecraft missions to
the Sun increase our understanding of that most fundamental
of all energy sources, paving the way for the efficient conversion
of solar energy into many practical applications, and
releasing us from dependence on ever-decreasing reserves
of fossil fuels. Spacecraft circling the Earth study the upper
atmospheric processes that play major roles in controlling
our weather. These same spacecraft look down on Earth,
aiding us with increasingly accurate forecasts of weather and
crop productivity.</p>
<p>Looking beyond matters of technology and the environment,
the historian may cite the latter part of the twentieth
century as a time of explosive exploration, comparable
to the 15th and 16th century exploration of the Earth&rsquo;s oceans
and the distant lands that bounded them. In a sense, exploration&mdash;whether
it is physical or intellectual&mdash;provides its
own rewards. The United States has always been a nation
that moves forward, pushing back the frontiers of the West,
pushing back the frontiers of social and economic development,
and now pushing back the frontiers of space. It is
arguable that this spirit of exploration is indispensable to a
vigorous society, and that any society that ceases to explore,
to inquire, and to strive is only a few years from decline.</p>
<p>And so the historian may recall the early days of lunar
exploration, the Apollo project, the landing of unmanned
Viking spacecraft on Mars, and the encounters of Voyager
spacecraft with Jupiter and Saturn as the first steps in a sustained
program of space exploration&mdash;a program that is
profoundly changing man&rsquo;s perspective of himself, of the
Earth, and of the larger cosmos beyond.</p>

Galilean satellite. The surface displays a complex array of streaks, indicating that the crust
has been fractured. In contrast to its icy neighbors Ganymede and Callisto, Europa has
very few impact craters. The relative absence of features and low topography
indicate that the crust is young and probably warm a few kilometers below the
surface. The warmth is probably due to a combination of radioactive and tidal
heating. The tidal heating within Europa is estimated to be ten percent that of the
stronger tidal heating effect within Io. The regions that appear blue in this Voyager 2

kilometers in diameter) are identifiable in this Voyager 2 picture, indicating that this

not as young as Io&rsquo;s surface. Scientists believe that the surface is a thin ice crust
overlying water or softer ice and that the fracture systems are breaks in the crust.
Resurfacing processes, such as the production of fresh ice or snow along the

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">The Voyager Mission</span></h2>
<p>The Voyager mission is focused on the exploration of
the Jupiter and Saturn systems. The alignment of these
large planets permits the use of a gravity-assist trajectory
in which the gravity field of Jupiter and Jupiter&rsquo;s motion
through space may be used to hurl the spacecraft on to
Saturn. In 1977, a rare alignment (once every 176 years)
of our four outer planets&mdash;Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune&mdash;may permit a gravity-assist trajectory to Uranus
and even to Neptune for Voyager 2.</p>
<p>Voyagers 1 and 2 began their journeys in the late
summer of 1977, catapulted into space by a Titan/Centaur
launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral, Florida.
With them went the hopes and dreams of thousands of
people who had worked to create them and their mission.</p>
<p>The Voyager spacecraft are unique in many respects.
Since their journeys are taking them far from the Sun, the
Voyagers are nuclear powered rather than solar powered.
The Voyagers are the fastest man-made objects ever to
have left Earth. In fewer than ten hours, they had crossed
the Moon&rsquo;s orbit. This compares to about three days for
an Apollo flight and one day for the Mariner and Viking
spacecraft. Their launches marked the end of an era in
space travel&mdash;the end of the planned use of Titan/Centaur
launch vehicles. With the advent of the Space
Shuttle in the 1980s, future spacecraft will be launched
from the Shuttle Orbiter.</p>
<p>Voyager 1 was launched 16 days after its sister ship,
but because of a different trajectory, it arrived at Jupiter
four months ahead of Voyager 2. Both spacecraft spent
more than nine months crossing the asteroid belt, a vast
ring of space debris circling the Sun between the orbits of
Mars and Jupiter. During their 16- and 20-month journeys
to Jupiter, the spacecraft tested and calibrated all of
their instruments, exercised their scan platforms, and
measured particles and fields in interplanetary space. As
the spacecraft neared the planet, the cameras showed the
dramatic visible changes that had taken place in the five
years since Jupiter had been photographed by Pioneer 11.
And for the first time, we got a close look at some of Jupiter&rsquo;s
moons: Amalthea, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and
Callisto.</p>
<p>Targeted for the closest look at Io, Voyager 1 flew the
more hazardous course, passing between Jupiter and Io,
where the radiation environment is the most intense. Voyager
2&rsquo;s flight path gave Jupiter and its intense radiation a
much wider berth. Unlike Voyager 1, which encountered
the five innermost satellites as it was leaving Jupiter, Voyager
2 encountered the satellites as it was approaching the
planet, thus providing closeup photography of opposite
sides of the satellites.</p>

spacecraft measured the large, doughnut-shaped ring of
charged sulfur and oxygen ions, called a torus, encircling
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
the planet at about the orbit of Io. Then, both spacecraft
disappeared behind Jupiter, out of view of Earth and Sun,
for about two hours. During this time, measurements were

15,000 photographs of Jupiter and its satellites.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Voyager spacecraft and scientific instruments.</i></p>
</div>
<p>From the moment of launch, the Voyager spacecraft
have been monitored by a worldwide tracking system of
nine giant antennas strategically located around the world
in California, Spain, and Australia to ensure constant radio
contact with the spacecraft as the Earth rotates. Radio
contact with Voyagers 1 and 2 has not been instantaneous,
however. When Voyager 1 flew past Jupiter, radio signals
between Earth and the spacecraft took 37 minutes; when
Voyager 2 arrived, the signals took 52 minutes because by
then the planet was farther from Earth.</p>
<p>The pictures in this book were taken by a shuttered
television-type camera. Each picture is composed of
640,000 dots, which were converted into binary numbers
before being radioed to Earth. When the signals reached
Earth, they were reconverted by computer into dots and
reassembled into the original image. Most of the color
pictures are composed of three images, each one taken
through a different color filter: blue, orange, or green. The
images were combined and the original color was reconstructed
by computer. The computer eliminated many of
the imperfections that crept into the images, and enhanced
some of the images by emphasizing different colors.</p>
<p>Designed to provide a broad spectrum of scientific
investigations at Jupiter, the science instruments investigated
atmospheres, satellites, and magnetospheres. The
scientific investigations for the Voyager mission and their
Jovian encounter objectives are shown in the table on <a href="#Page_40">page 40</a>.</p>
<p>After their closest approaches to Jupiter, both spacecraft
fired their thrusters, retargeting for their next goal,
the Saturn system. Scientists will still be studying the wealth
of new information about Jupiter when Voyager 1 reaches
Saturn in November 1980, and Voyager 2 follows in August
1981. After Voyager 1 encounters Saturn, Voyager 2 may
be retargeted to fly past Uranus in 1986. Upon completion
of their planetary missions, both spacecraft will search
for the outer limit of the solar wind, that boundary somewhere
in our part of the Milky Way where the influence of
the Sun gives way to other stars of the galaxy. Voyagers 1
and 2 will continue to study interstellar space until the
spacecraft signals can no longer be received.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">Scientific Highlights</span></h2>
<p>Some of the most important information gathered by
Voyagers 1 and 2 on the Jovian system is presented pictorially
in this book and is supplemented here with brief
summaries of the major discoveries, observations, and
theories.</p>
<h3 id="c6">Jupiter</h3>
<p>The atmosphere of Jupiter is colorful, with cloud
bands of alternating colors. A major characteristic of the
atmosphere is the appearance of regularly spaced features.
Around the northern edge of the equator, a train of
plumes is observed, which has bright centers representative
of cumulus convection similar to that seen on Earth.
At both northern and southern latitudes, cloud spots are
observed spaced almost all the way around the planet,
suggestive of wave interactions. The cloud structures in
the northern and southern hemispheres are distinctly different.
However, the velocities between the bright zones
and dark belts appear to be symmetric about the equator,
and stable over many decades. This suggests that such
long-lived and stable features may be controlled by the
atmosphere far beneath the visible clouds. The Great Red
Spot possesses the same meteorological properties of
internal structure and counterclockwise rotation as the
smaller white spots. The color of the Great Red Spot may
indicate that it extends deep into the Jovian atmosphere.
Cloud-top lightning bolts, similar to those on Earth, have
also been found in the Jovian atmosphere. At the polar
regions, auroras have been observed. A very thin ring of
material less than one kilometer (0.6 mile) in thickness
and about 6000 kilometers (4000 miles) in radial extent has
been observed circling the planet about 55,000 kilometers
(35,000 miles) above the cloud tops.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Amalthea</h3>
<p>Amalthea is an elongated, irregularly shaped satellite
of reddish color. It is 265 kilometers (165 miles) long and
150 kilometers (90 miles) wide. Just like the large Galilean
satellites, Amalthea is in synchronous rotation, with its long
axis always oriented toward Jupiter. At least one significant
color variation has been detected on its surface.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Io</h3>
<p>Eight active volcanoes have been detected on Io, with
some plumes extending up to 320 kilometers (200 miles)
above the surface. Over the four-month interval between the
Voyager 1 and 2 encounters, the active volcanism appears to
have continued. Seven of the volcanoes were photographed
by Voyager 2, and six were still erupting.</p>
<p>The relative smoothness of Io&rsquo;s surface and its volcanic
activity suggest that it has the youngest surface of Jupiter&rsquo;s
moons. Its surface is composed of large amounts of sulfur
and sulfur dioxide frost, which account for the primarily yellow-orange
surface color. The volcanoes seem to eject a sufficient
amount of sulfur dioxide to form a doughnut-shaped
ring (torus) of ionized sulfur and oxygen atoms around Jupiter
near Io&rsquo;s orbit. The Jovian magnetic field lines that go through
the torus allow particles to precipitate into the polar regions
of Jupiter, resulting in intense ultraviolet and visible auroras.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Europa</h3>
<p>Europa, the brightest of Jupiter&rsquo;s Galilean satellites,
may have a surface of thin ice crust overlying water or softer
ice, with large-scale fracture and ridge systems appearing in
the crust. Europa has a density about three times that of
water, suggesting it is a mixture of silicate rock and some
water. Very few impact craters are visible on the surface,
implying a continual resurfacing process, perhaps by the
production of fresh ice or snow along cracks and cold
glacier-like flows.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Ganymede</h3>
<p>Ganymede, largest of Jupiter&rsquo;s 13 satellites, has bright
&ldquo;young&rdquo; ray craters; light, linear stripes resembling the outer
rings of a very large, ancient impact basin; grooved terrain
with many faults; and regions of dark, heavily cratered terrain.
Among the Galilean satellites, Ganymede probably has
the greatest variety of geologic processes recorded on its surface
and may be the best example for studying the evolution
of Jupiter&rsquo;s inner satellites. Imbedded within Jupiter&rsquo;s magnetosphere,
Ganymede is subjected to the influences of the
corotating charged-particle plasma and an interaction may
exist with this plasma. No atmosphere has been detected.</p>
<h3 id="c11">Callisto</h3>
<p>The icy, dirt-laden surface of Callisto appears to be
very ancient and heavily cratered. The large concentric rings
indicate the remains of several enormous impact basins, created
by huge meteors crashing into the surface, and since
erased by the flow of the crust. Callisto&rsquo;s density (less than
twice that of water) is very close to that of Ganymede, yet
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
there is little or no evidence of the crustal motion and internal
activity that is visible on Ganymede.</p>
<h3 id="c12">The Magnetosphere</h3>
<p>Perhaps the largest structure in the solar system is the
magnetosphere of Jupiter. This is the region of space which
is filled with Jupiter&rsquo;s magnetic field and is bounded by the
interaction of that magnetic field with the solar wind, which
is the Sun&rsquo;s outward flow of charged particles. The plasma
of electrically charged particles that exists in the magnetosphere
is flattened into a large disk more than 4.8 million
kilometers (3 million miles) in diameter, is coupled to the
magnetic field, and rotates around Jupiter. The Galilean satellites
are located in the inner regions of the magnetosphere
where they are subjected to intense radiation bombardment.
It appears that Io is a source of the sulfur and oxygen ions
which fill the magnetosphere. Another magnetospheric
interaction is the electrical connection between Io and Jupiter
along the magnetic field lines that leave Jupiter and intersect
Io. This magnetic flux tube was examined by Voyager 1
and a flow of about five million amperes of current was
measured, which was considerably more than anticipated.
Voyager also discovered a new low-frequency radio emission
coming from Jupiter, which is possibly associated with the
Io torus.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
